Assessment: Term   Paper
Question One.
It has long been observed that an irregularly repeating sequence of   technological advances and RD lie at the core of capitalism and many major   powers   throughout history have sought to monopolise this process. While major powers have often managed to get their hands on the levers of   this process, these world powers never succeed in keeping their hands on these levers for long. Schumpeter (1942) coined the term creative-destruction to   capture         the   essence   of   this   process   of   technological   progress. Schumpeterian   creative-destruction appears to drive long-run national growth, economic fluctuations, and largely limit the   strategies that firms can deem feasible.
At   the   level   of   individual   organisations, thereappear   to   exist   forces   that   continually incentivise the taking of risk and making of complex decisions to reorganise   the organisations markets and contracts, often for operational reasons   and less frequently,   for   strategic reasons. Whether those decisions are successful or not   depends   partly   on managerial talent and partly on sound institutions to provide a   safe   scaffolding for the   change to materialise. Failure along the institutional dimension   appears to   create   negative macroeconomic consequences if   it interferes in creative-destruction. While some limits are inherent to the sheer complexity of such decisions, others have their genesis in ill-conceived   economic and organisational ideas or seeking to achieve   desirable human   goals,   such   as   basic human rights to life, liberty, human capital and private property.   (See Caballero,   2008).
Anglo-Saxon economies appear to be the best organised among others to incentivise the   taking of risks inherent in entrepreneurial activity. While innovation and breakthrough creativity appear most often in these liberal and democratic   nations, these   economies   also   experience disastrous financial cycles of   booms and recessions but also   recur   in   puzzling            cycles.
China, with limited political freedom and continued growth claims it   has found   a better balance between innovation and growth without theses crashes than liberal societies that   have high political freedom and slowing growth, although these are   already highly   developed. A socialist approach is necessary, says China, to restrict markets   to   transactions   that are morally acceptable to society and political power   should   decide where markets   should   operate, or   else   markets   will   corrode   theverything   it   promises   to   provide.
Liberal economies claim that lack of   freedom and political restrictions mean that   citizens will   refrain from risking creativity unless authorised by the state. While states start   out wise, they   tend to become more corrupt than liberal markets and, more importantly, have historically been unable to see the next technological breakthrough that disrupts the world.
Required:
In the light of   these competing claims, supporting either the liberal   approach   or   the   socialist      approach   (but not both) to managing national economic affairs, discuss the role   of   financial   markets in delivering an affordable and good quality of   life   for   people, while limiting   the likelihood   of   financial   crises   and   the   inevitable   consequences   that   people   end   up   bearing.

Question TWO.
There is no doubt that living standards have risen sharply for billions of   people   in the   last 200 years since the advent of   the industrial revolution and the   spread   of   capitalist   market   economies, as compared to the poverty, violence and oppression experienced by almost   all   humans in the previous 2,000 years, bar the ruling elites.    Markets   are the   solution   not the   problem and what we want is a market society, not   merely   a   market   economy.
However, we also see that inequality in market economies has risen   sharply around   the   world, as confirmed by rising Gini-coefficients. Furthermore, we that increasingly
i)                            the global   economy   is becoming f代 写BE432 Financial Crashes and Consequences 2023-2024

ii)                         the financial markets   are more   susceptible   to   crashes   even   for those   that   have   secure employment and safe futures due to high levels   of   inflation,
iii)                      wars are being fought with unimaginable collateral   damage   falling   on   ordinary   people caught in the cross-hairs of a powerful military-industrial complex,
iv)                      migration   appears the   only   avenue   and, for   many in   marginal   and   oppressed
societies,a   final   last-ditch   do-or-die   attempt, creating   fear   and   loathing   in   the developed world for the new “migrants”, all the while forgetting that many in the   developed world are but themselves the children of earlier migrants.
Surprisingly the rising inequality can be seen in nations like the USA and UK with democratic politics and market capitalism as well as in   nations, like   China   and   Russia with   state-controlled politics and market capitalism. Capitalism appears to have triumphed everywhere. Nevertheless, the   world   appears   to   becoming   full   circle, back   to   the protectionism-economics   and   ultra-right   nationalisms   of   Germany   and   Japan   ofthe   early   20th   century, an unprecedented period in human history that saw two world wars with more   than   100 million dead.
If   this   recent   trend   of   rising   inequality   continues, the   world   will   be   ruled   by   a   private members club of   plutocrats: membership of   the club requires   a net worth   of £1 billion. The rest will have no basic human rights and will be employees who can be bought as wage   slaves. However, as Elon Musk said in   an interview with the   UK   Prime   Minister,   Rishi   Sunak,   the   planet   will   shortly   reach   a   stage   where   noone   has   to   work, if   they   do   not   want, work   will be optional because artificial intelligence and robots will do   all the work. Provided   technology is allowed to perform. its function, all of   humanity can   enjoy a   good   quality life,   irrespective   of   where   they   chose   to   live.
These perspectives are the looming future reality and not merely   a   dystopian   and   unlikely   future.
Required:
In the light of   these competing claims, discuss whether we are destined to forever   repeat   the   mistakes   of   the   last   800 years   of   financial   crashes, irrespective   of   ideology, merely that we can look forward to crashing with better technology, while people bear   the same consequences in each crash, or   might there be   workable   solutions   to   the   predicament   humanity   appears   to   have   found   itself   in   at   the   end   of   the   first   quarter   of the 21st    century?

IMPORTANT
Pay attention to the need for a sound,   justified, valid argument.
No sitting on the fence (do not give   me,   on the   one hand   ….   on the   other hand),   and   please ensure you make a clear, explicit decision as to which   side   of   the   fence   you have chosen to sit, supported by good argument for your choice   of   position.
Ensure you include counter arguments undermining potential arguments that   oppose your own while supplying evidence to support   your own.
See the marking rubric below and be well briefed on how the marks are distributed.
